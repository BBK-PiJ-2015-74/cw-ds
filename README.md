/** 
* Files provided in the src-repo directory, already included as part of the coursework:
* AbstractStack.java
* ErrorMessage.java
* FunctionalList.java
* ImprovedStack.java
* List.java
* ReturnObject.java
* SampleableList.java
* Stack.java
*
*
* Files I have created 
* Ex 1. ReturnObjectImpl.java is a class that implements interface ReturnObject, and is just a way of handling errors
* Ex 2. ArrayListImpl is a class that implements interface List @see ArrayListImpl.java
* Ex 3. LinkedListImpl is a class that implements interface List @see LinkedListImpl.java
* There is also a test of interface List called ListTest.java (this should work the same for both ArrayListImpl and LinkedListImpl
*/

/**
* anything marked "//" are notes to be deleted before handing in
*
* Class ReturnObjectImpl is just a way of handling errors
* Note that constructors do not have to have all the fields in the class: think of the slots analogy
* Constructors have a special syntax public Classname () {
* 										fields which are instantiated in the class go here
* 										}
*/

/**
* As at Tuesday 15th December, ReturnObjectImpl.java compiles
* Can't get the test script to work though. This won't compile. Perhaps need to test it with a real linked list?
